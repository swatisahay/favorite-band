      <p>Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead singer and pianist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at
         University College London. After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as bassist and they
         changed their name to Starfish. Will Champion joined as drummer and backing vocalist, completing the lineup. Creative director
         and former manager Phil Harvey is often referred to as the fifth member by the band. The band renamed themselves "Coldplay"
         in 1998, before recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998 and Brothers and Sisters and The Blue Room in 1999. The
         Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <div class="column">
      <p>Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland first met during their orientation week at University College London in September 1996.
         The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz. Guy Berryman,
         a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed
         gigs for local Camden promoters at small clubs. Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend Phil Harvey, who was
         studying classics at the University of Oxford, to be the band's manager. Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth
         member of the group. The band's line-up was completed when Will Champion joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had
         grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and tin whistle; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience).
         The band finally settled on the name "Coldplay" which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using
         the name for his group.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>By 1997, Martin had met Classics student Tim Rice-Oxley. During a weekend in the English village Virginia Water in Surrey they
         asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's
         keyboard player but Rice-Oxley refused as his own band, Keane, was already active. Days after, this event would shape the
         second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets. In 1998, the band released
         500 copies of the Safety EP. Most of the discs were given to record companies and friends; only 50 copies remained
         for sale to the public. In December of that year, Coldplay signed to the independent label Fierce Panda. Their
         first release was the three-track Brothers and Sisters EP, which they had quickly recorded over
         four days in February 1999.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <p>After completing their final examinations Coldplay signed a five-album contract with Parlophone in early 1999.
         After making their first appearance at Glastonbury the band went into the studio to record a third EP, titled The Blue Room.
         Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October and the single "Bigger Stronger" received BBC Radio
         1 airplay. The recording sessions for The Blue Room were tumultuous. Champion was briefly fired from the band, but Martin
         later pleaded with him to return after kicking him out, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually,
         the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands like
         U2 and R.E.M., Coldplay decided that they would operate as a democracy. Additionally, the band determined they would fire
         anyone who used hard drugs.</p>
